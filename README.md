# GUI-Based-Data-Cleaning
### Overview
The Data Cleaning Tool provides two different ways to clean and preprocess datasets:

1. ** Streamlit-based Interactive Web App ** - A user-friendly interface for data cleaning and reporting.

2. ** Command Line Interface (CLI) Tool ** - A terminal-based interactive tool for cleaning datasets.

Both tools support CSV and Excel file formats and provide functionalities such as removing columns, handling missing values, changing data types, and generating data reports.
